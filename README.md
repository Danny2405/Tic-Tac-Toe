# Tic-Tac-Toe (Console Game)

## 📌 Project overview

This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.

I built it after earning my PCEP certification and during my PCAP – Python Essentials 2** training.  
The main goal was to practice Python fundamentals through a complete, self-contained project, from input handling to game logic.

The project focuses on clarity, robustness, and logic, rather than advanced AI or graphics.
